I 
loved 
it 
and 
would 
go 
again 
. 


I 
will 
be 
going 
back 
and 
heartily 
recommend 
it 
! 


Probably 
would 
not 
go 
back 
here 
. 


Everyone 
was 
more 
then 
happy 
with 
his 
choices 
. 


I 
love 
this 
place 


The 
food 
can 
get 
pricey 
but 
the 
prixe 
fixe 
tasting 
menu 
is 
the 
greatest 
food 
for 
a 
good 
price 
and 
they 
cater 
the 
food 
to 
any 
food 
allergies 
or 
food 
you 
don't 
like 
. 


The 
Yellowtail 
was 
particularly 
good 
as 
well 
. 


The 
staff 
is 
very 
good 
. 


The 
service 
varys 
from 
day 
to 
day 
- 
sometimes 
they're 
very 
nice 
, 
and 
sometimes 
not 
. 


Great 
neighborhood 
joint 
. 


I 
think 
the 
pizza 
is 
so 
overrated 
and 
was 
under 
cooked 
. 


I 
found 
it 
on 
a 
cold 
night 
, 
the 
perfect 
spot 
to 
warm 
up 
. 


Bagels 
are 
ok 
, 
but 
be 
sure 
not 
to 
make 
any 
special 
requests 
! 


Place 
is 
open 
till 
late 
, 
no 
dress 
code 
. 


Too 
bad 
the 
food 
wasn't 
of 
the 
same 
heritage 
. 


The 
most 
pleasant 
surprise 
was 
the 
check 
that 
did 
not 
exceed 
my 
expectations 
as 
it 
always 
happens 
in 
most 
of 
the 
places 
. 


If 
you 
are 
going 
for 
the 
food 
, 
it 
will 
not 
be 
worth 
it 
. 


At 
$ 
120 
for 
two 
people 
, 
however 
, 
this 
in 
no 
way 
represents 
value 
, 
unless 
you're 
looking 
to 
pay 
by 
the 
hour 
for 
passive-aggressive 
torture 
. 


I 
had 
the 
kafta 
plate 
and 
I 
enjoyed 
it 
. 


I 
like 
Cafe 
Noir 
dont 
get 
me 
wrong 
, 
it 
is 
jsut 
that 
the 
people 
who 
work 
there 
are 
evil 
and 
incompetent 
! 
! 


I'd 
definitely 
go 
back 
again 
. 


Just 
ignore 
the 
trendy 
wannabes 
. 


The 
food 
was 
lousy 
- 
too 
sweet 
or 
too 
salty 
and 
the 
portions 
tiny 
. 


I 
highly 
recommend 
Caviar 
Russe 
to 
anyone 
who 
wants 
delicious 
top 
grade 
caviar 
and 
fantastic 
service 
. 


This 
is 
right 
up 
there 
with 
places 
in 
Tokyo 
as 
far 
as 
the 
freshness 
is 
concerned 
. 


I 
stumbled 
upon 
this 
great 
pizzeria 
as 
I 
explored 
my 
new 
neighborhood 
. 


( 
The 
asparagus 
, 
truffle 
oil 
, 
parmesan 
bruschetta 
is 
a 
winner 
! 
) 


They 
refuse 
to 
seat 
parties 
of 
3 
or 
more 
on 
weekends 
. 


Not 
cheap 
but 
very 
yummy 
. 


Loved 
it 
! 


We 
left 
, 
never 
to 
return 
. 


Wow 
. 


It 
melted 
in 
my 
little 
mouth 
and 
the 
perfect 
consistency-not 
too 
fishy 
, 
creamy 
, 
and 
slightly 
buttery 
. 


Wonderful 
at 
holiday 
time 
. 


The 
menu 
has 
so 
many 
fish 
items 
and 
oysters 
. 


( 
2 
) 
egg 
custards 
and 
pork 
buns 
at 
either 
bakery 
on 
west 
side 
of 
Mott 
street 
just 
south 
of 
Canal 
. 


– 
We 
love 
breakfast 
food 
. 


It 
is 
obvious 
that 
no 
one 
in 
the 
restaurant 
has 
any 
idea 
about 
or 
experience 
with 
Japanese 
cuisine 
. 


Overall 
, 
I 
would 
go 
back 
and 
eat 
at 
the 
restaurant 
again 
. 


The 
fish 
was 
really 
, 
really 
fresh 
. 


The 
ambiance 
was 
a 
peaceful 
and 
relaxing 
break 
amongst 
all 
the 
kids 
running 
around 
in 
Downtown 
Disney 
. 


This 
is 
the 
perfect 
spot 
for 
meeting 
friends 
, 
having 
lunch 
, 
dinner 
, 
pre-theatre 
or 
after-theatre 
drinks 
! 


They 
all 
know 
you 
. 


Gross 
food 
– 
Wow 
- 


Poor 
service 
and 
management 


I 
tried 
a 
couple 
other 
dishes 
but 
wasn't 
too 
impressed 
. 


The 
dessert 
( 
we 
had 
a 
pear 
torte 
) 
was 
good 
- 
but 
, 
once 
again 
, 
the 
staff 
was 
unable 
to 
provide 
appropriate 
drink 
suggestions 
. 


The 
food 
and 
service 
were 
fine 
, 
however 
the 
maitre-D 
was 
incredibly 
unwelcoming 
and 
arrogant 
. 


– 
Best 
Mexican 
place 
for 
lunch 
in 
the 
financial 
district 
. 


Nice 
value 
. 


It 
was 
romantic 
- 
and 
even 
nice 
even 
with 
my 
sister 
, 
reminded 
me 
of 
Italy 
, 
and 
had 
artwork 
and 
music 
that 
kept 
up 
the 
feeling 
of 
being 
in 
a 
Mediterrean 
villa 
. 


I 
would 
go 
back 
for 
the 
wine 
experience 
alone 
. 


I've 
enjoyed 
99 
% 
of 
the 
dishes 
we've 
ordered 
with 
the 
only 
exceptions 
being 
the 
occasional 
too-authentic-for-me 
dish 
( 
I'm 
a 
daring 
eater 
but 
not 
THAT 
daring 
) 
. 


The 
concept 
of 
japanese 
tapas 
is 
newly 
created 
and 
clearly 
doesn't 
work 
. 


Fish 
was 
overdone 
. 


The 
pizza 
is 
yummy 
and 
I 
like 
the 
atmoshpere 
. 


We 
were 
less 
than 
impressed 
. 


I 
had 
fish 
and 
my 
husband 
had 
the 
filet 
- 
both 
of 
which 
exceeded 
our 
expectations 
. 


I 
went 
there 
after 
hearing 
how 
great 
it 
was 
. 


To 
start 
off 
, 
approximately 
8-10 
oz 
of 
orange 
juice 
will 
cost 
you 
$ 
3 
. 


Kind 
, 
attentive 
wait 
staff 
. 


We 
paid 
a 
fixed 
pricce 
but 
got 
nothing 
! 
! 


Wretched 
and 
retching 


We've 
tried 
before 
but 
it 
always 
packed 
and 
doesn't 
take 
reservations 
. 


We 
did 
arrive 
late 
for 
our 
reservation 
so 
I 
can 
not 
complain 
too 
much 
about 
the 
wait 
for 
a 
table 
. 


At 
first 
we 
were 
a 
little 
taken 
aback 
, 
as 
this 
seemed 
to 
present 
a 
problem 
, 
although 
the 
restaurant 
looked 
fairly 
empty 
, 
but 
they 
hastily 
put 
the 
table 
together 
for 
us 
. 


The 
service 
was 
fast 
and 
friendly 
and 
the 
food 
was 
very 
tasty 
and 
they 
had 
the 
best 
hot 
sauce 
to 
add 
to 
your 
meals 
. 


This 
small 
Astoria 
souvlaki 
spot 
makes 
what 
many 
consider 
the 
best 
gyros 
in 
New 
York 
. 


I 
will 
have 
to 
do 
more 
research 
before 
checking 
out 
new 
places 
based 
on 
Diners 
, 
drive-ins 
and 
dives 
reviews 
. 


HOWEVER 
, 
one 
Sunday 
afternoon 
my 
husband 
and 
I 
did 
go 
( 
although 
with 
my 
loud 
protests 
) 
and 
were 
pleasantly 
surprised 
. 


You 
can 
do 
it 
here 
. 


Great 
vibe 
, 
lots 
of 
people 
. 


Addicting 
! 


I 
never 
used 
to 
be 
a 
fan 
of 
sakes 
but 
am 
lately 
experimenting 
with 
it 
a 
lot 
more 
and 
am 
acquiring 
a 
better 
taste 
of 
it 
. 


skip 
dessert 
. 


I 
would 
say 
that 
all 
was 
fine 
and 
tasty 
but 
the 
heaviness 
on 
my 
stomach 
someting 
that 
i 
can't 
not 
mention 
or 
undermine 
. 


I 
fell 
in 
love 
with 
the 
egg 
noodles 
in 
the 
beef 
broth 
with 
shrimp 
dumplings 
and 
slices 
of 
BBQ 
roast 
pork 
. 


But 
$ 
500 
for 
a 
dinner 
for 
two 
that 
didn't 
include 
Wine 
? 


The 
owner 
is 
belligerent 
to 
guests 
that 
have 
a 
complaint 
. 


I 
wasn't 
here 
for 
the 
pizza 
so 
I 
can't 
comment 
on 
that 
yet 
but 
what 
I 
had 
was 
very 
good 
. 


i 
would 
normally 
not 
finish 
the 
brocolli 
when 
i 
order 
these 
kinds 
of 
food 
but 
for 
the 
first 
time 
, 
every 
piece 
was 
as 
eventful 
as 
the 
first 
one 
... 
the 
scallops 
and 
prawns 
was 
so 
fresh 
and 
nicely 
cooked 
. 


Moderate 
prices 
.

Enjoyed 
the

Service

and 
I 
liked 
the

c 
I 
live 
in 
a

who 
always 
seem 
disappointed 
with 
their 
tips 
. 


There 
are 
so 
many 
better 
places 
to 
visit 
! 


The

was

,

inexpertly 
sliced 
.

You 
Can't 
Go

Here 
. 


Love 
the 
enchiladas 
and 
chicken 
soup 
- 
and 
be 
sure 
to 
check 
out 
their 
specials 
. 


Chicken 
teriyaki 
had 
tomato 
or 
pimentos 
on 
top 
? 
? 


( 
Besides 
that 
there 
should 
be 
more 
restaurants 
like 
it 
around 
the 
city 
) 
. 


I 
do 
not 
think 
dinner 
in 
Manhattan 
should 
cost 
$ 
400.00 
where 
I 
am 
not 
swept 
off 
my 
feet 
. 


The 
naan 
was 
some 
of 
the 
best 
I've 
had 
and 
I 
really 
enjoyed 
the 
bhartha 
, 
not 
too 
tomatoey 
. 


The 
entree 
was 
also 
very 
good 
. 


This 
establishment 
is 
the 
real 
deal 
. 


I 
have 
been 
to 
this 
place 
, 
folks 
and 
it 
is 
BAD 
. 


Try 
the 
congee 
and 
the 
donut 
like 
deep 
fried 
dough 
they 
call 
Ow 
Ley 
Soh 
, 
a 
delicious 
and 
sweet 
tasting 
bread 
. 


Overrated 


I 
have 
been 
to 
Roth's 
twice 
and 
both 
times 
were 
very 
disappointing 
. 


I 
think 
that 
it 
is 
absolutely 
brilliant 
and 
well 
runned 
business 
operation 
. 


Not 
only 
have 
I 
worked 
in 
restaurants 
for 
many 
years 
, 
I 
am 
now 
in 
culinary 
school 
, 
I 
am 
a 
huge 
lover 
of 
oysters 
and 
fish 
, 
and 
my 
girlfriend 
is 
half 
Korean 
! 


Excellent 
sashimi 
, 
and 
the 
millennium 
roll 
is 
beyond 
delicious 
. 


You 
need 
to 
watch 
your 
game 
, 
they 
will 
have 
it 
on 
for 
you 
. 


We 
were 
offered 
water 
for 
the 
table 
but 
were 
not 
told 
the 
Voss 
bottles 
of 
water 
were 
$ 
8 
a 
piece 
. 


Insultingly 
Overpriced 


If 
celebrities 
make 
you 
sweat 
, 
then 
your 
in 
for 
a 
ride 
, 
but 
if 
your 
like 
most 
around 
these 
parts 
then 
you'll 
just 
yawn 
and 
wonder 
whats 
with 
all 
the 
hype 
. 


– 
The 
food 
is 
here 
is 
incredible 
, 
though 
the 
quality 
is 
inconsistent 
during 
lunch 
. 


They 
don't 
concern 
much 
of 
customer's 
health 
, 
just 
want 
to 
make 
money 
. 


We 
had 
a 
good 
time 
. 


i 
have 
eaten 
here 
a 
handful 
of 
times 
, 
for 
no 
reason 
besides 
sheer 
convenience 
. 


Great 
food 
, 
amazing 
service 
, 
this 
place 
is 
a 
class 
act 
. 


One 
of 
the 
best 
, 
if 
not 
THE 
best 
, 
restaurants 
in 
Park 
Slope 
( 
and 
NY 
in 
general 
) 


The 
pizza 
’ 
s 
are 
thin 
crust 
and 
the 
menu 
offers 
very 
creative 
combinations 
and 
toppings 
. 


I'm 
not 
sure 
where 
the 
other 
reviewers 
ate 
but 
it 
seems 
as 
if 
we 
visited 
two 
different 
restaurants 
because 
my 
friends 
and 
I 
all 
enjoy 
Mizu 
very 
much 
... 
and 
we're 
repeat 
customers 
. 


I 
was 
here 
a 
few 
weeks 
back 
and 
we 
had 
the 
worst 
customer 
service 
experience 
at 
a 
restaurant 
ever 
. 


In 
fact 
there 
is 
only 
one 
I've 
tried 
that 
even 
compares 
( 
shabu 
Tatsu 
) 
and 
even 
then 
I 
prefer 
Dokebi 
. 


The 
food 
was 
very 
good 
, 
filet 
mignon 
was 
probably 
the 
best 
I've 
ever 
try 
. 


If 
it's 
nice 
outside 
, 
request 
for 
a 
table 
in 
the 
balcony 
. 


The 
pastas 
are 
incredible 
, 
the 
risottos 
( 
particularly 
the 
sepia 
) 
are 
fantastic 
and 
the 
braised 
rabbit 
is 
amazing 
. 


The 
bread 
was 
stale 
, 
the 
salad 
was 
overpriced 
and 
empty 
. 


The 
food 
is 
prepared 
quickly 
and 
efficiently 
. 


The 
wine 
list 
is 
wonderful 
and 
the 
food 
reminds 
me 
of 
my 
recent 
trip 
to 
Italy 
. 


This 
is 
an 
amazing 
place 
to 
try 
some 
roti 
rolls 
. 


splendid 


What 
really 
makes 
it 
shine 
is 
the 
food 
, 
which 
is 
aggressively 
seasoned 
with 
Cyrpriot 
spices 
, 
and 
all 
made 
in-house 
( 
even 
the 
gyro 
meat 
and 
sausages 
) 
, 
and 
made 
of 
much 
higher 
quality 
ingredients 
that 
might 
otherwise 
be 
expected 
. 


I 
don't 
get 
it 
either 
. 


Try 
the 
Pizza 
Ensalata 
! 


The 
service 
was 
quick 
and 
friendly 
. 


The 
food 
they 
serve 
is 
not 
comforting 
, 
not 
appetizing 
and 
uncooked 
. 


Nobody 
at 
this 
restaurant 
will 
give 
firm 
answers 
about 
anything 
and 
in 
the 
end 
, 
not 
one 
person 
takes 
responsibility 
for 
anything 
. 


One 
of 
us 
actually 
liked 
the 
expresso 
- 
that's 
it 
. 


I 
loved 
everythig 
about 
it-especially 
the 
shows 
and 
actors 
. 


The 
food 
arrived 
20 
minutes 
after 
I 
called 
, 
cold 
and 
soggy 
. 


I 
thought 
the 
restaurant 
was 
nice 
and 
clean 
. 


Highly 
recommended 
! 


Leon

East 
Village

I 
would 
recommend 
Roxy's 
for 
that 
, 
but 
not 
for 
their 
food 
. 


This 
is 
by 
far 
my 
favorite 
place 
in 
the 
neighborhood 
. 


The 
food 
was 
exceptional 
. 


The 
rice 
was 
poor 
quality 
and 
was 
cooked 
so 
badly 
it 
was 
hard 
. 


My 
wife 
and 
I 
went 
to 
Water's 
Edge 
for 
a 
romantic 
dinner 
. 


The 
servers 
behind 
the 
counter 
are 
always 
friendly 
and 
helpful 
. 


i 
would 
recommend 
reservations 
on 
weekends 
though 
. 


There 
is 
something 
about 
their 
atmosphere 
that 
makes 
me 
come 
back 
nearly 
every 
week 
. 


The 
decor 
in 
this 
place 
is 
very 
diner-ish 
and 
the 
kind 
of 
place 
you 
expect 
in 
the 
East 
Village 
- 
not 
romantic 
, 
just 
simple 
, 
small 
and 
sparse 
. 


Get 
the 
pepperoni 
- 
YUM 
- 
and 
a 
family 
style 
salad 
. 


I 
love 
breakfast 
here 
. 


They 
forgot 
a 
sandwich 
, 
didn't 
include 
plastic 
forks 
, 
and 
didn't 
include 
pita 
with 
the 
hummus 
platter 
. 


I 
have 
been 
doing 
all 
of 
the 
above 
at 
the 
Heartland 
Brewery 
for 
over 
5 
years 
now 
and 
I 
HAVE 
NEVER 
BEEN 
DISAPPOINTED 
! 


It's 
a 
little 
out 
of 
our 
price 
range 
for 
dining 
there 
except 
on 
special 
occasions 
, 
but 
we've 
eaten 
there 
6 
times 
in 
the 
last 
2 
years 
. 


We 
all 
ordered 
different 
entrees 
so 
we 
could 
share 
. 


Molto 
bene 
! 


We 
went 
to 
celebrate 
two 
birthdays 
and 
wanted 
to 
do 
something 
special 
and 
different 
. 


Went 
on 
a 
Monday 
night 
, 
so 
there 
was 
no 
wait 
for 
a 
table 
. 


I 
went 
there 
for 
lunch 
and 
it 
was 
not 
as 
good 
as 
I 
expected 
from 
the 
reviews 
I 
read 
. 


If 
you're 
in 
the 
area 
you 
shouldn't 
be 
disappointed 
. 


We 
had 
the 
lobster 
sandwich 
and 
it 
was 
FANTASTIC 
. 


It's 
a 
small 
cute 
restaurant 
. 


Good 
luck 
getting 
a 
table 
. 


My 
party 
had 
the 
BBE 
$ 
29 
fixe 
prix 
menu 
, 
which 
was 
such 
a 
wonderful 
deal 
since 
it 
also 
came 
with 
a 
flight 
of 
sake 
! 


All 
in 
all 
we're 
already 
coming 
up 
with 
excuses 
to 
go 
ahead 
really 
soon 
in 
the 
next 
few 
wks 
! 
! 
! 


Its 
a 
good 
thing 
my 
daughter 
had 
some 
snacks 
in 
her 
lunch 
bag 
. 


Best 
Reuben 
sandwich 
ever 
! 


All 
their 
menu 
items 
are 
a 
hit 
, 
and 
they 
serve 
mimosas 
. 


Well 
, 
I 
guess 
maybe 
it 
might 
be 
beneficial 
for 
the 
management 
to 
pay 
a 
visit 
to 
Tutta 
Bella 
in 
Columbia 
City 
for 
some 
tips 
. 


Great 
food 
, 
better 
Margaritas 
! 


Try 
their 
chef's 
specials 
- 
- 
they 
are 
to 
die 
for 
. 


On 
my 
meal 
I 
had 
to 
send 
back 
my 
eggs 
for 
a 
simple 
request 
of 
breaking 
the 
yokes 
before 
cooking 
, 
and 
would 
have 
had 
to 
send 
them 
back 
again 
if 
I 
hadn't 
rejected 
the 
meal 
all 
together 
. 


Perhaps 
now 
, 
Scooner 
or 
Later 
falls 
into 
the 
" 
Dive 
" 
category 
. 


Food 
was 
very 
good 
, 
but 
not 
what 
I 
would 
consider 
out 
of 
this 
world 
. 


The 
place 
was 
quiet 
and 
delightful 
. 


Overall 
the 
food 
quality 
was 
pretty 
good 
, 
though 
I 
hear 
the 
salmon 
is 
much 
better 
when 
it 
hasn't 
sat 
cooling 
in 
front 
of 
the 
guest 
. 


The 
service 
was 
the 
only 
thing 
good 
about 
this 
restaurant 
. 


first 
it 
took 
us 
a 
long 
time 
to 
find 
the 
place 
. 


Why 
is 
it 
that 
( 
almost 
) 
every 
good 
review 
is 
by 
" 
anonymous 
? 
" 


Sit 
outside 
in 
the 
warm 
weather 
; 
inside 
for 
cozy 
winter 
. 


Everyone 
was 
smiling 
so 
that 
made 
me 
feel 
welcome 
. 


Just 
go 
to 
Yamato 
and 
order 
the 
Red 
Dragon 
Roll 
. 


Cool 
atmosphere 
, 
the 
fire 
place 
in 
the 
back 
really 
ads 
to 
it 
but 
needs 
a 
bit 
more 
heat 
throughout 
on 
a 
cold 
night 
. 


Food 
is 
excellent 
. 


i 
love 
their 
chicken 
pasta 
cant 
remember 
the 
name 
but 
is 
sooo 
good 


The 
pizza 
’ 
s 
are 
not 
huge 
and 
the 
crust 
is 
thin 
… 
keep 
that 
in 
mind 
when 
you 
’ 
re 
ordering 
. 


This 
little 
place 
definitely 
exceeded 
my 
expectations 
and 
you 
sure 
get 
a 
lot 
of 
food 
for 
your 
money 
. 


Not 
recommanded 
! 
! 
! 


I'm 
going 
back 
. 


The 
cold 
appetizer 
dishes 
taste 
like 
the 
way 
I 
remember 
them 
to 
taste 
when 
I 
was 
growing 
up 
in 
Taiwan 
. 


Obviously 
the 
Chinese 
translation 
of 
this 
place 
does 
not 
mean 
Big 
Wong 
, 
it 
actually 
means 
Great 
Prosperity 
. 


I 
thanked 
my 
friend 
who 
recommended 
me 
this 
restaurant 
and 
will 
certainly 
recommend 
it 
to 
others 
. 


Hurley's 
is 
like 
Cheers 
where 
everyone 
knows 
your 
name 
and 
they 
are 
ACTUALLY 
glad 
you 
came 
. 


Well 
... 
they 
can 
run 
but 
they 
can't 
hide 
. 


The 
waitress 
, 
seems 
to 
be 
more 
concerned 
of 
looking 
good 
than 
actually 
waitressing 
. 


Always 
good 
. 


I 
haven't 
been 
to 
the 
other 
locations 
. 


but 
overall 
i 
give 
it 
a 
10 


The 
restaurant 
was 
80 
% 
full 
and 
there 
was 
a 
sign 
posted 
" 
wait 
to 
be 
seated 
. 
" 


The 
food 
is 
tasty 
and 
portion 
sizes 
are 
appropriate 
. 


The 
hot 
dogs 
are 
top 
notch 
, 
and 
they're 
Slamwich 
is 
amazing 
! 


The 
food 
is 
great 
and 
the 
environment 
is 
even 
better 
. 


I'm 
not 
even 
going 
to 
bother 
to 
describe 
it 
; 
it 
speaks 
for 
itself 
. 


The 
place 
is 
beautiful 
! 


We 
never 
had 
to 
wait 
more 
than 
5 
minutes 
. 


We 
easily 
spent 
more 
than 
$ 
40 
per 
person 
( 
not 
including 
alcohol 
) 
and 
were 
still 
hungry 
. 


Over 
100 
different 
choices 
to 
create 
your 
own 
. 


Everything 
, 
and 
I 
mean 
everything 
on 
the 
menu 
is 
delectable 
. 


Nice 
food 
but 
no 
spice 
! 


I 
love 
sushi 
, 
and 
I 
have 
eaten 
it 
all 
over 
the 
world 
. 


Thanks 
Bloom's 
for 
a 
lovely 
trip 
. 


Dumbfoundingly 
Poor 


We 
put 
out 
name 
down 
and 
although 
there 
were 
open 
tables 
we 
were 
told 
that 
it'd 
be 
a 
30 
minute 
wait 
. 


The 
hostess 
was 
rude 
and 
I 
got 
a 
distinct 
feeling 
that 
they 
did 
not 
want 
to 
serve 
us 
. 


The 
food 
is 
simply 
unforgettable 
! 


We 
got 
most 
of 
it 
back 
at 
home 
with 
us 
. 


It 
was 
the 
first 
place 
we 
ate 
on 
our 
first 
trip 
to 
New 
York 
, 
and 
it 
will 
be 
the 
last 
place 
we 
stop 
as 
we 
head 
out 
of 
town 
on 
our 
next 
trip 
to 
New 
York 
. 


Always 
a 
nice 
crowd 
, 
but 
never 
loud 
. 


Planet 
Thai 
is 
great 
! 


My 
GF 
and 
I 
dine 
at 
Bukhara 
often 
as 
she 
lives 
near 
it 
. 


I 
thought 
going 
to 
Jimmys 
would 
give 
me 
a 
real 
Domincan 
exprience 
. 


They 
have 
a 
huge 
selection 
of 
different 
cream 
cheeses 
and 
all 
of 
their 
salads 
are 
great 
. 


I 
wish 
I 
COULD 
be 
refunded 
! 


Many 
people 
talk 
about 
the 
great 
pizza 
and 
poor 
service 
, 
so 
it 
can't 
just 
be 
the 
rantings 
of 
a 
few 
dissatisfied 
customers 
. 


great 
food 


The 
only 
thing 
that 
my 
friend 
left 
out 
is 
that 
when 
we 
sat 
down 
at 
the 
bar 
the 
bartender 
disappeared 
. 


Great 
, 
original 
taste 
. 


The 
blond 
wood 
decor 
is 
very 
soothing 
, 
the 
premium 
sake 
is 
excellent 
and 
the 
service 
is 
great 
. 


Our 
experience 
did 
not 
ever 
get 
any 
better 
. 


oh 
speaking 
of 
bathroom 
, 
the 
mens 
bathroom 
was 
disgusting 
. 


Oh 
, 
and 
the 
cheese 
fries 
are 
awesome 
! 


supercilious 
scorn 
is 
in 
. 


When 
I 
got 
there 
I 
sat 
up 
stairs 
where 
the 
atmosphere 
was 
cozy 
& 
the 
service 
was 
horrible 
! 


Arigato 
Gozimas 
Yuka 
! 


During 
the 
course 
of 
the 
past 
3 
months 
, 
the 
chef 
and 
staff 
changed 
and 
it 
was 
not 
for 
the 
better 
. 


By 
far 
the 
best 
salad 
I 
have 
had 
in 
a 
fast 
food 
restaurant 
. 


The 
worst 
excuse 
for 
Japanese 
food 
I've 
ever 
encountered 
. 


I 
have 
never 
left 
a 
restaurant 
feeling 
as 
if 
i 
was 
abused 
, 
and 
wasted 
my 
hard 
earned 
money 
. 


Aside 
from 
the 
Sea 
Urchin 
, 
the 
chef 
recommended 
an 
assortment 
of 
fish 
including 
Fatty 
Yellow 
Tail 
, 
Boton 
Shrimp 
, 
Blue 
Fin 
Torro 
( 
Fatty 
Tuna 
) 
, 
Sea 
Eel 
, 
etc 
. 


The 
tuna 
and 
wasabe 
potatoes 
are 
excellent 
. 


Once 
you're 
inside 
, 
the 
real 
experience 
begins 
. 


Will 
definitely 
be 
back 
. 


Told 
us 
to 
sit 
anywhere 
, 
and 
when 
we 
sat 
he 
said 
the 
table 
was 
reserved 
. 


This 
is 
one 
of 
my 
favorite 
restaurants 
and 
it 
is 
not 
to 
be 
missed 
. 


Winnie 
and 
her 
staff 
are 
the 
best 
crew 
you 
can 
find 
serving 
you 
. 


We've 
found 
it 
to 
be 
better 
and 
fresher 
than 
Kiku 
which 
is 
comparable 
in 
price 
. 


Not 
because 
you 
are 
" 
The 
Four 
Seasons 
" 
... 
– 
you 
are 
allowed 
to 
charge 
an 
arm 
and 
a 
leg 
for 
a 
romatic 
dinner 
. 


But 
too 
far 
east 
! 


Service 
ok 
but 
unfriendly 
, 
filthy 
bathroom 
. 


WORST 
PLACE 
ON 
SMITH 
STREET 
IN 
BROOKLYN 


The 
best 
! 


It's 
a 
rather 
cramped 
and 
busy 
restaurant 
and 
it 
closes 
early 
. 


My 
girlfriend 
, 
being 
slightly 
more 
aggressive 
, 
and 
having 
been 
equally 
disgusted 
causing 
her 
to 
throw 
out 
the 
remainder 
of 
her 
barely 
eaten 
meal 
, 
called 
back 
only 
to 
be 
informed 
that 
I 
was 
probably 
wrong 
and 
that 
it 
was 
most 
likely 
an 
oyster 
, 
and 
that 
we 
were 
also 
blacklisted 
from 
their 
restaurant 
. 


What 
more 
can 
you 
ask 
for 
? 


I 
have 
it 
a 
4 
instead 
of 
5 
because 
of 
the 
price 
( 
just 
chicken 
tikka 
masala 
- 
no 
bread 
of 
rice 
- 
is 
$ 
25 
) 
, 
which 
I 
would 
expect 
at 
a 
upscale 
Indian 
restaurant 
but 
this 
place 
doesn't 
have 
an 
upscale 
feel 
. 


the 
brocollis 
were 
so 
fresh 
and 
tasty 
. 


For 
those 
that 
go 
once 
and 
don't 
enjoy 
it 
, 
all 
I 
can 
say 
is 
that 
they 
just 
don't 
get 
it 
. 


we 
were 
tired 
and 
cold 
when 
we 
got 
to 
the 
restaurant 
, 
then 
we 
sat 
down 
to 
begin 
ordering 
appetizers 
. 


His 
response 
was 
smug 
, 
arrogant 
, 
and 
condescending 
, 
totally 
consistent 
with 
his 
deportment 
on 
display 
all 
evening 
. 


My 
wife 
also 
ordered 
a 
teapot 
of 
hot 
water 
( 
she 
had 
a 
sore 
throat 
) 
and 
I 
guess 
that 
since 
it 
was 
only 
water 
, 
it 
wasn't 
a 
priority 
for 
them 
to 
actually 
bring 
it 
. 


The 
shrimp 
scampi 
was 
excellent 
and 
the 
antipasti 
were 
plentiful 
. 


Best 
Sushi 
in 
town 
. 


– 
By 
far 
the 
best 
bar 
in 
the 
east 
village 
... 


The 
decor 
however 
seems 
to 
be 
the 
distraction 
so 
you 
won't 
notice 
that 
you 
just 
payed 
300 
bucks 
for 
some 
cold 
eggplant 
that 
took 
2 
FRICKIN 
HOURS 
TO 
COME 
! 
! 
! 


the 
spinach 
is 
fresh 
, 
definately 
not 
frozen 
...
